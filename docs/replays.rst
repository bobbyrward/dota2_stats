.. Replays

Replays
===================================================================

Where can I get the URL for a match's replay?
Replays are formed from the following URL:
Code:

http://replay<cluster>.valve.net/570/<match_id>_<replay_salt>.dem.bz2

Where <cluster>, <match_id> and <replay_salt> are available from the fields in GetMatchDetails.

See https://developer.valvesoftware.com/..._2_Demo_Format for details on how to parse downloaded replay files
